For now there are only fixes for shaders, but several improvements are possible in the future, so:

## current TODO:

1) Make the bar above the mobs scale depending on the screen resolution / GUI scale in the mc settings
2) Make it so that the bar above mobs displayed not only when you look at the mob (now this works very poorly / practically does not work)
